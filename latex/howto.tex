We've seen that when browsing the online documentation, it's quite
easy to look at a C++ definition and see how to use it in Python and
what it's useful for.  It's much harder to go the other way: given a
goal, what are the classes that enable that goal?  This chapter
provides answers for common tasks. If you encounter a task you think
should be listed here, just send it to us and we'd be happy to include
it.
