% interactive python

Python is able to remember your history from one session to another, and to use TAB to help you with your
typing by completing variable names and object methods.

One way to get these features is to use \verb|iPython| (\url{http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/}).  If you want to avoid installing another package, you can home-brew your environment.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Create a file \verb|$HOME/.pythonstartup|
  \item Set the environment variable \verb|PYTHONSTARTUP| to point there, e.g. \verb|export PYTHONSTARTUP=$HOME/.pythonstartup| (or the csh equivalent with \verb|setenv|)
  \item Put the following lines in \verb|$HOME/.pythonstartup|:
\begin{verbatim}
import re, os

# The place to store your command history between sessions
histfile=os.environ["HOME"] + "/.python-history"
            
try:
    # Try to set up command history completion/saving/reloading
    import readline, atexit, rlcompleter

    isEditline = False
    try:
        if re.search(r"^/System/Library", readline.__file__): # editline; the BSD rewrite of readline
            isEditline = True
    except AttributeError:
        pass

    if isEditline:
        readline.parse_and_bind("bind ^I rl_complete")
        readline.parse_and_bind("bind ^R em-inc-search-prev")
        readline.parse_and_bind("bind ^U ed-move-to-beg em-next-word")
    else:                               # readline
        readline.parse_and_bind('tab: complete')

    readline.set_history_length(-1)     # don't truncate history list

    try:
        readline.read_history_file(histfile)
    except IOError:
        pass  # It doesn't exist yet.

    def savehist(nsave=1000):
        try:
            readline.set_history_length(nsave)
            readline.write_history_file(histfile)
        except Exception, msg:
            print 'Unable to save Python command history:', msg

    atexit.register(savehist)
    del atexit
except ImportError:
    pass
\end{verbatim}

That may look complicated, but it should work on os/x as well as linux boxes.  And you should see the version that I \textit{really} use...

\end{itemize}
